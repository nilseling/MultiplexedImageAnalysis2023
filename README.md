# Multiplexed Image Analysis

This repository hosts the scripts to reproduce the analysis presented in the practical session of [Tumors and the immune system 2023 - High dimensional spatial profiling of tumor microenvironment](https://www.cb.uzh.ch/en/Education/Compulsory-courses/ModuleB.html)

## Install software

To follow along, please install the following software:

* [FIJI](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads)

The practical session is split into 4 sessions:

1. [File type conversion](#file-type-conversion)
2. [Image visualization with FIJI](#image-visualization-with-fiji)
3. [Pixel classification-based image segmentation](pixel-classification-based-image-segmentation)
4. [Interactive image analysis with QuPATH](#interactive-image-analysis-with-qupath)
